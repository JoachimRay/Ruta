# Ruta
Ruta is a web application that helps commuters navigate jeepney and bus routes in Cebu. It provides route options, fare details, and location guidance to make public transportation easier and more efficient.

Temporary: added minimal Next.js app file `app/page.js` that renders "RUTA" so the build output includes a visible page. Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to regenerate `.next`.
